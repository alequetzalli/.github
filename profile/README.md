## ✨ Welcome
Welcome to the Open-Source (OSS) [AsyncAPI Initiative](https://www.asyncapi.com/), now moved [under the Linux Foundation](https://www.linuxfoundation.org/en/press-release/linux-foundation-will-host-asyncapi-to-support-growth-and-collaboration-for-industrys-fastest-growing-api-spec/). ❤️ AsyncAPI seeks to improve the current state of Event-Driven Architectures (EDAs) and the tooling system around them. We are a caring community 👐🏿, shaping the future of how you work with `#EventDrivenArchitecture`, no matter if it is Kafka or Websockets.

Follow our [public roadmap](https://www.asyncapi.com/roadmap) ✨ and feel free to share your suggestions 🙇🏿‍♀️🙇🏿. Or better yet, [join our team](https://www.asyncapi.com/jobs) 🙌🏾!
